Until quite recently the quality of content generated by AI's was quite low, and clearly distinguishable from human work. However, in recent years this is no longer true. We now have models that can create high quality written texts, images, and even videos. This creates some questions around how this content should be used, and who actually owns the content. For example, if a user asks ChatGPT to generate a piece of test and they then use that text to generate some kind of profit, who is entitled to this money?",

In this case, if the user is entitled to the profit from a generated AI, then they should also be responsible for anything bad the AI does. But many would argue that it doesn't make sense for the user to be responsible for an AI that they did not develop. It could also be argued that the developers are the ones who put in the work to develop the AI, which consequently created the content. Comparatively, the user did very little work.",

The developers being entitled to the profit generated by their systems would align with the idea that they are also responsible for that AI. This would also align with current Irish IP law, which in instances of commissioned art gives copyright to the artist, not the commissioner. With the state of current AI this solution probably makes the most sense, assuming the company has not given explicit permission to their users to use their content. However, this may need to be revisited in the future as AI's advance, as there may come a point where the AI itself can be responsible for its content.",

While hypothetically this may be possible in the future, the unfortunate truth is this simply isn't possible with the current state of AI. They are physically not capable of this. For example, ChatGPT cannot store or interact with money in any capacity; nor is ChatGPT actually capable of making decisions. It's output are simply statistical calculations that predict the best sequence of words based on its training data.",

There are constant legal battles over IP infringement, and there are also significant cultural differences in how these are handled. This topic is still incredibly new, it is not even addressed in the recent EU AI Act. So, for now I just wanted to get you to start thinking about this. Start thinking about your own use of AI, and then consider the larger implications of this.",
